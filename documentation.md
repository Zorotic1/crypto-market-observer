## [26/01/27] Env Security Setup
* **context:** to initialize the structure of the observer.
* **decision:** implementation of etc etc.
* **rationale:**
    * `.env`: to prevent api key leakage.
    * `__pycache__`: prevent binary incompatibility between machines and potential merge conflicts.



## To-Do List
* add functionality to search with name instead of id for api
* further error checking with api (guardrails for character limit, character type, etc)
